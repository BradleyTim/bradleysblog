        <h1>Contact Me</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Due to the number of messages I receive everyday, for my own mental sanity, I’ve decided to remove an easy way to contact me. My time is valuable to me, my family and my friends, and I just have no way to respond to all of the messages I receive.</p>
            <p>If you’d like to hire me for consulting, you can book a paid call with me <a href="#">here.</a></p>
            <p>You can always <a href="#">tweet at me</a>. However again, I can’t respond to every <a href="#">tweet.</a></p>
